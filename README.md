# Haplotype Annotation Tool

## Purpose

This tool annotates features (like genes, exons) onto haplotypes represented within a Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) file. It uses a reference genome annotation (GFF3) and the GFA structure to project annotations onto specific paths within the graph.

## Usage

(Instructions on how to install and run the tool will go here.)
